# Cxbx

Cxbx is the original Xbox emulator.

## Origin

This repository is a mirror of shogun's work-in-progress branch of the original [SVN source](http://sourceforge.net/p/cxbx/code/HEAD/tree/branches/private/shogun/wip/) from sourceforge.

It is forked from [Echelon9](https://github.com/Echelon9) on Github, and includes the most recent changes.

## Goals

Explore the possibilities!
